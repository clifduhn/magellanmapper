# 3D blob detection parameters
# Copy this configuration template to a new file to customize settings

# many of these settings are used in the method described here:
# https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.feature.html#skimage.feature.blob_log
min_sigma_factor: 3 # make smaller to detect smaller blobs
max_sigma_factor: 5 # make larger to detect larger blobs
num_sigma: 10 # number of intermediate values between min/max
detection_threshold: 0.1 # make smaller to detect lower intensity blobs
overlap: 0.5 # overlap fraction from 0-1

# pixels to exclude along border after blob detection to avoid clumping
# along image borders
exclude_border: null # sequence in z,y,x
